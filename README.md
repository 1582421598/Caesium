# Caesium
Caesium is a Java bytecode obfuscator that I wrote for fun and figured I'd make public

Currently available mutators
* Class Folder (Turns classes into folders)
* Control Flow
* Crasher (Will crash almost every GUI based RE tool)
* Local Variable
* Line Number
* Number
* Polymorph
* Reference (invokedynamics)
* String

## Usage
Run the jar and select your mutators in the mutators tab and hit mutate. Done!
